      My name is Sin Lin. I'm 19 years old, and I live in Brooklyn, New York. I'm currently enrolled in the School of Engineering at the University of Virginia. 
      I'm majoring in Civil Engineering, and this summer I interned at the community-based company, Silicon Harlem, located in Silicon Harlem.
      Our research focuses on expanding broadband internet access and infrastructure to bridge the digital divide, as well as increasing digital literacy.
      This class is part of the SHAPE (Silicon Harlem Advanced Programs in Education) project, which I am a part of as one of the TAs.

      The infographics I've put up on this site are ones I've created as deliverables in the first few weeks of my internship.
      I wanted to share the work here as a way to provide resources for anyone who might find them interesting!
